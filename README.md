Aurous79 Feedback

This is a simple web app for a shisha bar/restuarant.  The owner wanted to create a feedback form in order to obtain customer information in return for supplying a discount fro their next bill.

This web app allows the user to complete the feedback form in oredr to be sent an automated email for their discount.  The management can login to the Admin page and run reports on the different type of answers.  Management can also view the data in a graph format.

This Dash app is inside the Flask app with a prefixed pathname so I can only create one graph for the user to view.  Saying that, I managed to display all the graphs needed onto one page which made it easily accessible to view/analyze data from the database.
